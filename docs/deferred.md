# Deferred features

Things we caught ourselves wanting to build "while we're here" — captured here instead of acted on. Review this list at the weekly Sunday review. Items only move back into a module spec when a real customer (or a real technical need) asks for them.

Format:
- [ ] <feature> — <why deferred> — <what would unblock it>

---

## Captured so far

- [ ] Production env loading via platform secrets — `@nestjs/config` reads from `.env` in dev, but production deploys need env vars from the platform (Fly.io secrets, Vercel env, etc.). Verify `ConfigModule` handles "no `.env` file present" in prod. Phase 3-ish, before first deploy.

- [ ] Phone uniqueness on `users` will need re-thinking in Phase 4 when guardians arrive. Multiple parents may share one phone number. Consider moving phone to a Guardian table or relaxing uniqueness. — currently `@unique` on `users.phone` — Phase 4 trigger.

- [ ] Convert from `dotenv-cli` test wrapper to a shared test bootstrap that loads env the same way Nest does — keeps test and runtime env-loading aligned. — Phase 1 or before, low priority.

- [ ] Migrate from bearer-token sessions to full Better Auth integration (cookies, OAuth, magic links, 2FA). Captured in ADR-001. Trigger: before parent OTP flows ship in Phase 4, or when a school owner asks for SSO.

- [ ] Refactor audit log writes from direct (synchronous) to BullMQ queued, per the architecture doc. Signup is correctly an exception (atomic with school creation), but other modules should use the queue. — Phase 1 onward.

- [ ] Document the SECURITY DEFINER `auth_check_signup_uniqueness` SQL function with a code comment explaining *why* elevated privileges are intentional. — pre-Phase 1 cleanup.

- [ ] Fix root-level `pnpm dev:api` (Turbo wrapper). Currently `pnpm dev` from `apps/api` works, but the Turbo-wrapped version exits with code 3221225781. Once Turbo dev pipeline is debugged, the root command is the preferred way to start. — when it starts being annoying.

- [ ] Folder rename: `Naija-class` → `school-kit`. Cosmetic; mismatches project name. Will create fresh Docker volumes when done. — anytime there's a natural pause.
